----- > console.log(), write  to browsers  console, log messeges to the console, good 
                        for debugging


-------> document.write(), write to the browsers current html document
                           its a data model... anything done is immediately is immediately reflected
                           this writes to the html file dynamically
                        
                        document.write("<ul>");
                        for(var i in scores) {
                            document.write("<li>"scores["+i+"]) = " + 
                                                        scores[i]);
                            document.write("</li>");
                        }

                        document.write("</ul>");
                    similarly can create a dynamically create a table

                    ------->>>but the above methos is error prone<< ---- this is just for demonstration

Binding events
like onClick,

many of the time JS is mentioned in last so no initial loading should not take more time
bt syntatxtcally it should be in the head
