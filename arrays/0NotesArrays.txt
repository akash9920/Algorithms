Notes:

this is in reference to the question 
Using the ternary operator along with lambda:

this is what I was tryong to do:

return countZero + (return countTwo>CountFive? countTwo:countFiv; )

not working, but 2nd thought was to use lambda like:

return countZero + (return (x) - > x = countTwo>CountFive? countTwo:countFiv; )

but in lambda we cannot assign value to x as it an argument which is fundamentaly wrong?
(Though not sure about the argument)
I was 
(p) -> System.out.println("One parameter: " + p);
=======
In isBoomaerang question, approach was fine from initial but I was missing the basic point of floating value, I was considering int values with give me converted value
hence all the test cases were not passing so , this question taught me the basic of how to convert an in to float while division.
