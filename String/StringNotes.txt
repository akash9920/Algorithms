Notes:
1) for string pattern matching we can use KMP algorithm or subString as well, just look for that;

example is StrStr question

2) to get the integer value from a char is can be done by 

a) Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt(3))
b) Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(c)

if you wanna just get the asci value then just print as integer and it will give the ascii value;


// TODO:

1) how to read the negative values from the string, ex : converting a negative number to a string and then how can we get it back



// Questions Mindboggling

1) what could be the maximum size of a string?
is there any restriction, if yes then what can be that restriction
