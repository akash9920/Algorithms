when and how to see that a problem is a dynamic programming problem..

1) so my task for tomorrow will be to identify, how to identify the problem...!!

Start with the recursive backtracking solution
Optimize by using a memoization table (top-down[2] dynamic programming)
Remove the need for recursion (bottom-up dynamic programming)
Apply final tricks to reduce the time / memory complexity
