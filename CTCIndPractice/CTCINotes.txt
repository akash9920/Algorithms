why dfs with recursion or to prefer BFS
The advantage of the recursion solution is that it is easier to implement. However, 
there is a huge disadvantage: if the depth of recursion is too high, you will suffer 
from stack overflow. In that case, you might want to use BFS instead or implement DFS 
using an explicit stack.
