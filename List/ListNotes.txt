Notes:

when we want to find the common node in a LinkedList problem, we  should compare the node (the ListNode) not the values
as the values can be same. We can leverage only if the unique values are given.


for DetectCycle Question, 

    // we can use  ArrayList as well but that will slow down the run time. as per the run status
        // on leetcode HashMap gives 5ms,ArrayList took 43ms


Algo concepts used in question:

1) Floyds Cycle ref : DetectCycle question

This is the fastest method. Traverse linked list using two pointers.
Move one pointer by one and other pointer by two.  If these pointers
meet at same node then there is a loop.  If pointers do not meet then 
linked list doesnâ€™t have loop
